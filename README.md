## An Invitation to 3D Vision: A Tutorial for Everyone
_An Invitation to 3D Vision_ is a introductory tutorial on 3D vision (a.k.a. visual geometry or geometric vision).
It aims to make beginners understand basic theory of 3D vision and implement their own applications using [OpenCV][].
In addition to tutorial slides, we provide a set of example codes. The example codes are written as short as possible (mostly __less than 100 lines__) to improve readability and involve many interesting and practical applications.

* Download [tutorial slides](https://github.com/sunglok/3dv_tutorial/releases/download/misc/3dv_slides.pdf)
* Download [example codes in a ZIP file](https://github.com/sunglok/3dv_tutorial/archive/master.zip)
* Download [OpenCV binary](https://github.com/sunglok/3dv_tutorial/releases/download/misc/OpenCV_v3.2.0_32bit.zip) and [CLAPACK binary](https://github.com/sunglok/3dv_tutorial/releases/download/misc/CLAPACK_v3.2.1_32bit.zip) for Windows

### What does its name come from?
* The main title, _An Invitation to 3D Vision_, came from [a legendary book by Yi Ma, Stefano Soatto, Jana Kosecka, and Shankar S. Sastry](http://vision.ucla.edu/MASKS/). We wish that our tutorial will be the first gentle invitation card for beginners in 3D vision and explorers from other fields.
* The subtitle, _for everyone_, was inspired from [Prof. Kim's online lecture](https://hunkim.github.io/ml/) (in Korean). Our tutorial is also intended not only for students and researchers in academia, but also for hobbyists and developers in industries. We tried to describe important and typical problems and their solutions in [OpenCV][]. We hope readers understand it easily without serious mathematical background.
